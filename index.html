            <h2>Day 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit</h2>
            <p>Assign a sound to each of a group of keys on the keyboard and play the sound when the key is pressed</p>
            <a href="./exercises/01-JavaScriptDrumKit/index.html">See Results</a>
            <p>Things I learned/practiced:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The same custom data attribute can be assigned to multiple elements and then used to assign event listeners. This is preferred over using classes (which should be used for styles), id's (which should be used for reference), or elements (used for semantics). In this challenge, a custom data attribute matching a key number was assigned both to the key and to the audio tag that plays when the key is pressed.</li>
                <li><a href="http://keycode.info/" target="_blank">Keycode.info</a> is a simple tool that shows the corresponding key codes and other values for eack key you press</li>
                <li>rewind audio element to 0 before play to deal with repeated key presses. Once an audio starts playing, it will go until it ends. So, manually rewinding to the start of the audio clip allows to start playing from the beginning with each key press</li>
                <li>Can assign an event listener to the <b>transitionend</b> event to monitor css style changes that are animated and then act when the animation ends.</li>
                <li>Learned how to add a toggle switch (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools Tutorial</a>) using a checkbox input with a span spruced up with lots of styling. Assigned a click event handler to it to provide an on/off switch for the drum kit. (Need to better understand the use of :before and :after psuedo-codes in CSS styling)</li>
                <li>Used querySelector and querySelectAll to get one or an array of page elements. With the array, can then use map or forEach to assign classes or eventhandlers to each element</li>
                <li>Used classList add(), remove(), and value to alter the class assignments of element.</li>
                <li>Event Listeners - used addEventListener() and removeEventListener() to simulate turning the app on and off</li>
                <li>CSS styling is complex - need to better understand why the flexbox styles of the internal divs affect the display of the background image that is applied to the HTML tag and also work on the responsiveness (understand rems vs ems and the effect on using them for font sizes, margins, padding, border-radius, etc) </li>

            <h2>Day 2 - JS and CSS Clock</h2>
            <p>Build an analog clock display with second, minute, and hour hand using CSS and JavaScript</p>
            <a href="./exercises/02-JS-CSSClock/index.html">See Results</a>
            <p>Things I learned/practiced:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Moved the CSS and JS to external files and added the display of the date and time to go along with the analog clock display</li>
                <li>Each clock hand is a separate narrow div and the color is provided via background-color (not border). CSS positioning is used (relative on the parent clock-face div and absolute on the hand divs) to place each hand in the same starting position (12:00:00).</li>
                <li>Use the CSS transform:rotate(Xdeg) property to rotate the hands, with JS updating X each second.</li>
                <li>Initially, the transform:rotate() is done with the center of the div as the rotation point. Use the CSS transform-origin property to move the point of rotation to the end of the div, which is placed at the center of the clock.</li>
                <li>A CSS Bezier transition-timing-function is used to give the hands a realistic ticking motion. Chrome DevTools has a neat Bezier editor that can be used to adjust the 4 values of the time curve.</li>
                <li>One buggy thing is the transition from the 59 sec position to the 0 sec position for the hands since the transform quickly swings the hand counter-clockwise as it transforms the angle from 354deg to 0deg. Could fix this using JS to temporarily turn of the transition or could just keep a running total of the seconds rather than resetting to 0.</li>
                <li>This is mostly a CSS project. The JS is simple and just consists of using a setInterval timer that runs a function every second. The function grabs the current time and positions the hands based on the seconds, minutes, and hours.</li>
                <li>One other bug is that the hour hand stays at the exact hour position rather than slowly moving each minute. So, when the minute hand jumps from 59 to 0, the hour hand jumps to the next hour. Could make the hour hand move as expected by doing more math in the calculation of its position - e.g., move it 6 deg every 12 minutes.</li>
