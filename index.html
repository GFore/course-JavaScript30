            <h2>Day 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit</h2>
            <p>Assign a sound to each of a group of keys on the keyboard and play the sound when the key is pressed</p>
            <a href="./exercises/01-JavaScriptDrumKit/index.html">See Results</a>
            <p>Things I learned/practiced:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The same custom data attribute can be assigned to multiple elements and then used to assign event listeners. This is preferred over using classes (which should be used for styles), id's (which should be used for reference), or elements (used for semantics). In this challenge, a custom data attribute matching a key number was assigned both to the key and to the audio tag that plays when the key is pressed.</li>
                <li><a href="http://keycode.info/" target="_blank">Keycode.info</a> is a simple tool that shows the corresponding key codes and other values for eack key you press</li>
                <li>rewind audio element to 0 before play to deal with repeated key presses. Once an audio starts playing, it will go until it ends. So, manually rewinding to the start of the audio clip allows to start playing from the beginning with each key press</li>
                <li>Can assign an event listener to the <b>transitionend</b> event to monitor css style changes that are animated and then act when the animation ends.</li>
                <li>Learned how to add a toggle switch (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools Tutorial</a>) using a checkbox input with a span spruced up with lots of styling. Assigned a click event handler to it to provide an on/off switch for the drum kit. (Need to better understand the use of :before and :after psuedo-codes in CSS styling)</li>
                <li>Used querySelector and querySelectAll to get one or an array of page elements. With the array, can then use map or forEach to assign classes or eventhandlers to each element</li>
                <li>Used classList add(), remove(), and value to alter the class assignments of element.</li>
                <li>Event Listeners - used addEventListener() and removeEventListener() to simulate turning the app on and off</li>
                <li>CSS styling is complex - need to better understand why the flexbox styles of the internal divs affect the display of the background image that is applied to the HTML tag and also work on the responsiveness (understand rems vs ems and the effect on using them for font sizes, margins, padding, border-radius, etc) </li>

            <h2>Day 2 - JS and CSS Clock</h2>
            <p>Build an analog clock display with second, minute, and hour hand using CSS and JavaScript</p>
            <a href="./exercises/02-JS-CSSClock/index.html">See Results</a>
            <p>Things I learned/practiced:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Moved the CSS and JS to external files and added the display of the date and time to go along with the analog clock display</li>
                <li>Each clock hand is a separate narrow div and the color is provided via background-color (not border). CSS positioning is used (relative on the parent clock-face div and absolute on the hand divs) to place each hand in the same starting position (12:00:00).</li>
                <li>Use the CSS transform:rotate(Xdeg) property to rotate the hands, with JS updating X each second.</li>
                <li>By default, the transform:rotate() is done with the center of the div as the rotation point. Use the CSS transform-origin property to move the point of rotation to the end of the div, which is placed at the center of the clock.</li>
                <li>A CSS Bezier transition-timing-function is used to give the hands a realistic ticking motion. Chrome DevTools has a neat Bezier editor that can be used to adjust the 4 values of the time curve.</li>
                <li>One buggy thing is the transition from the 59 sec position to the 0 sec position for the hands since the transform quickly swings the hand 354 deg counter-clockwise as it transforms the angle from 354deg to 0deg rather than just moving 6 deg clockwise to the zero position. Could fix this using JS to temporarily turn of the transition or could just keep a running total of the seconds rather than resetting to 0. <span style="color: red">FIXED - Used if statment and the classList.toggle() function to toggle off/on the CSS transition when the hand is about to move from 59 to 0 postion.</span></li>
                <li>This is mostly a CSS project. The JS is simple and just consists of using a setInterval timer that runs a function every second. The function grabs the current time and positions the hands based on the seconds, minutes, and hours.</li>
                <li>One other bug is that the hour hand stays at the exact hour position rather than slowly moving each minute. So, when the minute hand jumps from 59 to 0, the hour hand jumps to the next hour. Could make the hour hand move as expected by doing more math in the calculation of its position - e.g., move it 6 deg every 12 minutes.  <span style="color: red">FIXED - hour hand now moves 6 deg every 12 min rather than 30 deg per hour.</span></li>

            <h2>Day 3 - CSS Variables</h2>
            <p>Use CSS Variables to allow user to change spacing, blur, and background color of a div</p>
            <a href="./exercises/03-CSSVariables/index.html">See Results</a>
            <p>Things I learned/practiced:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/r/root/" target="_blank">:root selector</a> is used to refer to the highest element in the DOM, which is the same as the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element in a webpage. It is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" target="_blank">psuedo-class selector</a> so it has specificity higher than an element selector. It is useful for declaring CSS variables.</li>
                <li>Declare CSS variables by preceding the variable name with "--" and then giving it a value in a style rule.</li>
                <li>Use variable by using it as the value inside of <code>var()</code> in a style rule.</li>
                <li>Calling <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll" target="_blank"><code>document.querySelectorAll('.controls input')</code></a> returns a NodeList (which is similar to an array) of input elements within the div that has the "controls" class. The argument in a querySelectorAll call must be a valid <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors" target="_blank">CSS Selector</a>.</li>
                <li>You can <a href="https://medium.com/@jsdevray/5-ways-to-loop-over-dom-elements-from-queryselectorall-in-javascript-55bd66ca4128" target="_blank">loop</a> over the elements of a NodeList just like you would an array.</li>
                <li>Console log a NodeList and then open it's <code>__proto__</code> property to see which methods are available on it.</li>

                <li>It is preferable to <a href="https://javascript.info/introduction-browser-events">handle element events</a> using <code>addEventListener()</code> rather than on&lt;event&gt; attributes since:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There can only be one on&lt;event&gt; per element since an element cannot have more than one property with the same name. The last one that is defined is the one that is used. However, an element can have multiple handlers assigned to an event by making multiple <code>addEventListener()</code> assignments, one for each of the handler functions.</li>
                        <li>It is more complicated to remove on&lt;event&gt; event listeners (assign its value to <code>null</code>). Listeners added via <code>addEventListener()</code> where the handler function is shown as a reference to the function's name (rather than being included as an anonymous function argument) can be removed with <code>removeEventListener()</code>, provided the exact same argument list is used.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Inside of an event handler function, <code>this</code> refers to the element the event listener is attached to.</li>
                <li>The 3rd argument in <code>addEventListener()</code> is a boolean that determines the phase, which means the order the handler functions will be run when there is conflict with a different event listener on a containing element (i.e. when you click a paragraph element you are also clicking the div element that contains it - this is event bubbling)</li>
                <li>When an event happens, the browser creates an <a href="https://javascript.info/introduction-browser-events#event-object">event object</a>, puts details into it and passes it as an argument to the handler.</li>
                <li>Use the dataset property to access all of the custom data attributes and their values.</li>

                <h2>Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1</h2>
                <p>Work with JS fundamentals by learning to correctly use array methods such as map, filter, sort, and reduce.</p>
                <a href="./exercises/04-ArrayCardioDay1/index.html">See Results</a>
                <p>Things I learned/practiced:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of showing the results in the console, I added HTML content so that I could get more practice using <code>querySelector()</code> and JS to add content to the page</li>
                    <li>Use <code>console.table()</code> to display an array as a table in the console.</li>
                    <li>The argument for filter, map, etc can be an arrow function to simplify things.</li>
                    <li>Use the filter() method to create a new array containing only the items from the original array that return true when matched against some boolean expression, leaving the original array intact</li>
                    <li>Use map() to return a new array that is the same length as the original array but where each item in the original array has been modified, leaving the original array intact</li>
                    <li>Use sort() to change the order of items in an array (the original array is modified). If no argument is provided, sort() attempts to sort the items in alpanumeric order when possible, or does nothing if the items cannot be sorted directly. If including a function, it takes two arguments at a time, compares them and swaps them if the comparison returns a value other than -1. It is common to use a ternary to return -1 if the values should be swapped or 1 if they should not be swapped.</li>
                    <li>The reduce() array method is a powerful tool for tracking an accumulated value while iterating over the elements of an array, such as a sum total of an integer field. The first argument is the reducer function which processes each item and adjusts the accumlator to reflect the item. The second argument provides an initial value for the accumlator, typically 0 for numeric accumlators. But, the reduce method can do many other things, such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Find the max or min value in a specific key/value pair in an array of objects</li>
                            <li>Sum values in an object array</li>
                            <li>Flatten an array of arrays</li>
                            <li>Counting the number of occurrences of each value in an array </li>
                            <li>Grouping objects by a property</li>
                            <li>Bonding arrays contained in an array of objects using the spread operator and initialValue</li>
                            <li>Remove duplicate items in array (this can also be done with Set and Array.from()</li>
                            <li>Running Promises in Sequence</li>
                            <li>Function composition enabling piping</li>
                        </ul>
                    See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce">MDN article on reduce</a> for more info.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use the column-width CSS property to make an HTML list display in multiple, responsive columns</li>
